Datafile Format
------------------
First line gives N, the number of particles in in the simulation.  The
second line gives the radius R of the universe: we can assume all
particles will be bewtween +/- R.  Then, there are N rows, each
containing 6 elements.  The first two are the initial x and y
positions of the bodies, the second two are the initial x and y
velocity of the bodies, and the last three are entries for RGB tuples
for drawing the particles in the output file.
